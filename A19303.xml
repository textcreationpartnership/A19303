         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which maner of preſentyng gyftes, as I do ryghte well alowe, if they be gyuen as a declaration of mutuall loue and hertie beneuolence: ſo the opinion therto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, I thynke not ſo commendable, whiche is, that the gyft ſhould be a token or preſage of good fortune to come: no more then mondayes handſel of a peny gyuen to a poore begger, ſhoulde be ſo eſteamed, that the happy begynnyng of the weke muſte drawe to it alſo a fortunate ende therof.</p>
            <p>The good intent of the gyuer of the peny: is to releue the poore mans neceſſitie, not to be an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurie of thinges that ſhal folowe. So in likewyſe ought the newe yeres gyftes to be deliuered, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a teſtimony of the hertie ſeruice or louynge myndes of the gyuers.

At the laſte when I conſydered your gracious entent and godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the readynge and ſtudie of holy ſcripture, and the auauncement of the trewe worde of God: I thought I coulde in no thynge do your grace a more pleaſaunt ſeruice, then to make an expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of certeyne pſalmes of the noble prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, whoſe harmonie is ſo ſwete &amp; pleaſaunt, that the eares of the faythfull, maye ſcantly therwith be fully ſatiſfied. The poetes faine that Orpheus made ſo pleaſaunt harmonie on his harpe that he cauſed the beaſtes and ſtones dauncing, to folow hym. Theyr meanynge was, that his language was ſo pleſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and his entent ſo reaſonable, that he brought the people to good ciuilitie, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore were rude and beaſtly. But our celeſtial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus the prophete Dauid hath ſo ſette forth his ſonges that they haue ſtrength and force to cauſe men which be carnall and beaſtly, to become ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heauenly. Who ſo wyll learne to geue to God dewe honoure and prayſes: maye in them take a perfecte patron.

In concluſion there is nothynge neceſſarie for any chriſtian to do, thynke, or ſaye, but in them as in a myrroure he maye beholde the perfecte image therof, biſyde the playne prophecienge of Chriſtes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng our very Meſſias, his natiuitie, paſſion, death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcention, as lyuely as they were in colours ſet forth before oure eyes, wyth ſo many tropes, figures and allegories, that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte no worde whiche lacketh na hidde miſterie, as the Apoſtle Paule ſayeth, all thynges happed to them in figure, and were darke and obſcure.</p>
